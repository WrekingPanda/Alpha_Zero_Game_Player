# Alpha Zero Game Player
 
## This prject was developed for the subject "Laboratório de Inteligência Artificial e Ciência de Dados" by the students André Sousa, António Cardoso, Antónia Brito and Paulo Silva.

### In this repository, we show our work which takes focus on creating an adversarial model inspirated on Alpha Zero capable of learning and playing the games of Go and Ataxx.

### To achieve this, we created a machine learning model based on the Alpha Zero aproach, making use of a Convolutional Neural Network and a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorythm.

### The trained models are on the Final_Models folder and they can be played against a human using the play_AI.ipynb notebook. Another way to play this, is with the client. SOMETHING!!!!!!!! and server. SOMETHING!!!!!!! files.
